                        First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) is one of the simplest types of scheduling algorithms used in operating systems for managing process execution. It operates under the principle that processes are attended to in the order in which they arrive in the ready queue, with no preemption. When considering FCFS with an arrival time of zero for all processes, it implies that all processes arrive at the system simultaneously and are ready to execute.
                        Let's break down the components you've mentioned to see how FCFS scheduling works when all processes have an arrival time of zero:
                        <br><span class="fw-bold">Process ID:</span> This is a unique identifier for each process. It's used to track and manage the processes throughout their life cycle in the system.
                        <br><span class="fw-bold">Arrival Time:</span> This indicates the time at which a process arrives in the ready queue and is ready to be executed. In this scenario, the arrival time for all processes is zero, meaning they all arrive at the same time.
                        <br><span class="fw-bold">Burst Time:</span> This is the total time required by a process to complete its execution. It's also known as the execution time or run time.
                        <br><span class="fw-bold">Waiting Time:</span> This is the amount of time a process has been in the ready queue waiting to get executed. Waiting time for a process is calculated as the difference between its Turnaround Time and its Burst Time.
                        <br><span class="fw-bold">Turnaround Time:</span> This represents the total time taken from the arrival of the process in the ready queue to its completion. It includes both the waiting time in the ready queue and the burst time (execution time).
                        <br><br>
                        Given that all processes arrive at the same time (arrival time = 0), the FCFS scheduling will simply execute the processes in the order they are presented or according to their Process IDs if that's the order of their arrival. The process that comes first in the list will be executed first, and so on.</p>
